# Dr. Robotnik's Ring Racers Crowd Control

# Setup

Load the Dr. Robotnik's Ring Racers Effect Pack in the Crowd Control app and set the path to your executable.
Once you are ingame, load the Crowd Control pk3 and the game should automatically try to connect.
Note that most effects will only work when in a map.
Additionally the mod is not supported for multiplayer yet, and will most likely cause desyncs if used.

# How to make the PK3

Open the SL_CrowdControl folder with [SLADE](http://slade.mancubus.net/index.php?page=downloads) and use the `Archive -> Build Archive` option to export it as a PK3.
